# Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism

This project is an implementation of image captioning using an attention mechanism. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset and achieves a BLEU score of 47. Image captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions for images, making it a valuable component in applications like computer vision and assistive technologies.

## Introduction

Image captioning is a challenging problem in computer vision and natural language processing. The goal of this project is to generate descriptive captions for images using an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism helps the model focus on different parts of the image while generating the caption, improving the quality of the generated captions.

## Dataset

I used the [Flickr8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k), which contains 8,000 images with five captions per image. This dataset is commonly used for image captioning tasks and provides diverse images and captions.

## Architecture

The image captioning model in this project utilizes an attention mechanism alongside a deep learning architecture. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the image as it generates each word in the caption.

## Results

The model achieved a BLEU score of 47 on the Flickr8k dataset, indicating the quality of generated captions. Below are some sample captions generated by our model:
